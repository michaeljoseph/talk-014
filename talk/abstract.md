Audience: Professional or amateur word smiths and crafters.

## Abstract

* Did you know that plain text is the only file format that every computer
  can parse?

* 9 out 10 Microsoft Word users tested, showed a decline in neural activity
  in the parts of the brain that governs one's self presentation instinct.
  They _literally_ lose the will to live.

## Summary

This talk will conduct an opinionated tour o the current state of the art in
text manipulation programs, workflows and associated (opinionated) best practices
(where best means efficient).

I will describe a relatively platform-agnostic setup and go into a little a bit
of detail about the virtues of each of the small, pointy tools in my toolbox.
Ladies.

I'll demonstrate some example workflows and automation, across the domains of 
programming, blogging, journalising, academic and other writing.

And then I'll stop talking.
Just kidding.
I _never_ stop talking.
I'll pause.
